# Crowd Control Simulator

## Simulate deploying officers to conduct mass arrests of protestors!

### Update

This app is not live [here](https://crowdcontrolsim.netlify.app/)

Three.js simulator of crowd and police dynamics, used for educational and experimental purposes. 

A dynamic, interactive simulation of riot crowd control! Watch as protestors, police officers, and vans interact in real time, demonstrating crowd dynamics, arrest logic, and vehicle extraction—all in your browser.

> **Note:** AI capabilities (such as natural language command input, OpenAI integration, or advanced scenario scripting) are **working but in deep development**. These features are paused for v1, and are being actively developed for version 2.

## 🚨 Features
- **Realistic crowd simulation:** Protestors flock, avoid, and react to police and vans.
- **Active police AI:** Officers proactively seek out and arrest protestors.
- **Van extraction:** Full vans break through crowds and deliver arrested protestors to prison.
- **Dynamic environment:** Buildings, roads, and a prison add strategic complexity.
- **Visual feedback:** See arrests, van capacity, and prison population in real time.
- **Highly configurable:** Tweak speeds, behaviors, and population sizes in `config.js`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🏗️ Deployment
- Ready for Netlify! See `netlify.toml` for configuration.

## 📚 Educational Purpose
This project is a **base template for educational purposes only**. Use it to learn about crowd simulation, agent-based AI, and interactive web graphics. Not intended for real-world law enforcement or sensitive applications.
